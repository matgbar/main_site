      <title>Callous Unemotional Meta-Analysis</title>

      <description>Abstract: Callous-unemotional (CU) traits are central to our understanding of antisocial behavior, which is harmful, financially costly to society, and hard to treat. Theoretical and diagnostic models define CU traits based on a lack of empathy, guilt, and prosociality. However, there has been no comprehensive quantitative synthesis of results to support this claim, nor any examination of whether associations differ by age, gender, sample type, or informant. Given its centrality to our understanding and treatment of antisocial behavior, the time is ripe for a critical examination of the meaning of the CU traits construct, including associations with its purported underlying features of low empathy, guilt, and prosociality, and potential demographic and methodological moderators of these associations.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Process Imputation Models</title>

      <description>I have become increasingly interested in the use of Gaussian process models as a tool for forecasting and imputation with univariate time series. See my blog post on the topic for more information and a toy forecasting problem.
I am currently working on a study examining the effectiveness of these models in imputing heart rate data that has been severely corrupted by artifact - to the point that there is not &amp;ldquo;enough&amp;rdquo; true signal remaining to do much of anything with.</description>

      <title>IBI VizEdit</title>

      <description>IBI VizEdit is a program built using RShiny. It is designed to assist in the manual editing of inter-beat interval files that are derived from photoplethysmogram (PPG) recordings. Unlike the electrocardiogram signal (EKG or ECG), PPG signals are characterized by a slow-moving waveform, which presents a different set of challenges when the true signal becomes corrupted by motion artefacts and other sources of noise.
Though increasingly popular due to their ease of use, most heart rate editing software that exists to date was designed and optimized for the detection and editing of inter-beat interval files derived from ECG signals.</description>

      <title>Social Withdrawal Meta-Analysis</title>

      <description>Are the terms anxious withdrawal, anxious solitude, behavioral inhibition, shyness-sensitivity, interchangeable? Are peer, parent, teacher, and self-perceptions of social withdrawal measuring the same thing? To date, researchers have relied on narrative arguments to build a case for or againts correspondence among the terms and measurement approaches used by developmental scientists interested in these and related constructs. I want to let the data speak for itself, and I am conducting a meta-analysis to do just that.</description>
