      <title>Callous Unemotional Meta-Analysis</title>

      <description>Abstract: Callous-unemotional (CU) traits are central to our understanding of antisocial behavior, which is harmful, financially costly to society, and hard to treat. Theoretical and diagnostic models define CU traits based on a lack of empathy, guilt, and prosociality. However, there has been no comprehensive quantitative synthesis of results to support this claim, nor any examination of whether associations differ by age, gender, sample type, or informant. Given its centrality to our understanding and treatment of antisocial behavior, the time is ripe for a critical examination of the meaning of the CU traits construct, including associations with its purported underlying features of low empathy, guilt, and prosociality, and potential demographic and methodological moderators of these associations.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Process Imputation Models</title>
      <link>https://mgb-research.netlify.com/project/gp/</link>

      <description>I have become increasingly interested in the use of Gaussian process models as a tool for forecasting and imputation with univariate time series. See my blog post on the topic for more information and a toy forecasting problem.
I am currently working on a study examining the effectiveness of these models in imputing heart rate data that has been severely corrupted by artifact - to the point that there is not &amp;ldquo;enough&amp;rdquo; true signal remaining to do much of anything with.</description>

      <title>IBI VizEdit</title>

      <description>IBI VizEdit is a program built using RShiny. It is designed to assist in the manual editing of inter-beat interval files that are derived from photoplethysmogram (PPG) recordings. Unlike the electrocardiogram signal (EKG or ECG), PPG signals are characterized by a slow-moving waveform, which presents a different set of challenges when the true signal becomes corrupted by motion artefacts and other sources of noise.
Though increasingly popular due to their ease of use, most heart rate editing software that exists to date was designed and optimized for the detection and editing of inter-beat interval files derived from ECG signals.</description>

      <title>Individual Risk for Anxiety and Depression</title>

      <description>Cell phones are ubiquitous on college campuses, annoying many an instructor who looks back at a classroom filled with young adults enamored with their black mirrors (and yes I am still very impressed with the underlying meaning of the hit Netflix series&amp;rsquo; title). As others have in the past Dr. Alex Shackman, sought to use the constant presence of cell phones to better understand the daily lives of individuals.
Using college students as subjects is often decried as laziness and viewed somewhat skeptically as investigators reaching out to a subject pool that is readily available to them.</description>

      <title>Preventing Anxiety in Early Childhood</title>

      <description>Dr. Ken Rubin has spent the majority of his career studying the causes, correlates, and consequences of childhood anxiety and social withdrawal. As a result of an ongoing collaboration with Dr. Andrea Chronis-Tuscano, a clinical psychology professor and researcher, and in consultation with Dr. Rob Coplan, this career has recently been translated into the creation of an early intervention program. The intervention, named the Turtle Program, simultaneously targets maladaptive parenting behaviors known to maintain and exacerbate childhood anxiety in addition to anxious and inhibited children&amp;rsquo;s social skills and emotion regulation deficits.</description>

      <title>Social Withdrawal Meta-Analysis</title>
      <link>https://mgb-research.netlify.com/project/sw-meta/</link>

      <description>Are the terms anxious withdrawal, anxious solitude, behavioral inhibition, shyness-sensitivity, interchangeable? Are peer, parent, teacher, and self-perceptions of social withdrawal measuring the same thing? To date, researchers have relied on narrative arguments to build a case for or againts correspondence among the terms and measurement approaches used by developmental scientists interested in these and related constructs. I want to let the data speak for itself, and I am conducting a meta-analysis to do just that.</description>
