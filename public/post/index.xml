      <description>Long ago (the first half of my grad school life), I created a model for a manuscript I submitted. The paper was focused on adolescents’ appraisals of their relationships with their mothers, fathers, and best friends. Specifically, I wanted to test whether the association between different motivations for social withdrawal (i.e., removing oneself from social activities and interactions) and internalizing symptoms varied as a function of perceived support in any one (or all three) of these relationships.</description>

      <description>Recently, I was asked to knock together a quick power analysis for a linear growth model with approximately 120 subjects. Having already collected data (i.e., having a fixed sample size), the goal of the power analysis was to explore whether a sample of 120 subjects would be sufficient to detect significant linear change (\(\alpha = .05\)) for a secondary research question that was not part of the original proposal (we added collection of a set of variables partway through the data collection period).</description>

      <description>A well-established set of problems emerges when attempting to analyze non-stationary univariate time series (i.e., the signal’s mean and/or variance changes over time). A common approach is to impose some stationarity on the data so that certain modeling techniques can provide allow a research to make some predictions (e.g., ARIMA models). The selection of the appropriate assumptions to make when forcing a time series into stationarity is difficult to automate in many circumstances, requiring that a researcher evaluate competing models.</description>
