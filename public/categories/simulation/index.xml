      <description>Recently I was asked to knock together a quick power analysis for a linear growth model with approximately 120 subjects. The power analysis was needed as part of a grant application. Having already collected data on the sample, the goal was to explore whether a sample of 120 subjects would be sufficient to detect significant linear change (\(\alpha = .05\)) for a secondary research question - which was not part of the original proposal (we added collection of a set of variables part way through the data collection period).</description>
