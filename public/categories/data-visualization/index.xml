      <description>Spurred on by my boss Alex Shackman, I have been working to figure out a good way to visualize different sources of variation in momentary mood. The most common way of visually depicting variance decompositions from the sort of multilevel models we used to analyze our data is a stacked bar plot. So that seemed like a good place to start.

      <description>It is official. The program I have spent the better part of a year working on, the very centerpiece of my dissertation, works. Or at least, early indicators are in, and based on 22 cases, some of which required a great deal of manual editing, the program is returning estimates in line with expectations.
Backing up, as I trip a little over my excitement, IBI VizEdit is an Rshiny application I created to help our lab process and edit heart rate data.</description>

      <description>You worked hard to collect, clean, and process your data. Now your dataset is finally ready for that final step. That put a bow on it and send it to all your colleagues phase. You are at that moment when you release a deep sigh of relief at the end of the hard (sometimes underappreciated) work of data wrangling. Now you have to make something that communicates all that you have done.</description>

      <description>Long ago (the first half of my grad school life), I created a model for a manuscript I submitted. The paper was focused on adolescentsâ€™ appraisals of their relationships with their mothers, fathers, and best friends. Specifically, I wanted to test whether the association between different motivations for social withdrawal (i.e., removing oneself from social activities and interactions) and internalizing symptoms varied as a function of perceived support in any one (or all three) of these relationships.</description>
