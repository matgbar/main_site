      <description>It is official. The program I have spent the better part of a year working on, the very centerpiece of my dissertation, works. Or at least, early indicators are in, and based on 22 cases, some of which required a great deal of manual editing, the program is returning estimates in line with expectations.
Backing up, as I trip a little over my excitement, IBI VizEdit is an Rshiny application I created to help our lab process and edit heart rate data.</description>

      <description>You worked hard to collect, clean, and process your data. Now your dataset is finally ready for that final step. That put a bow on it and send it to all your colleagues phase. You are at that moment when you release a deep sigh of relief at the end of the hard (sometimes underappreciated) work of data wrangling. Now you have to make something that communicates all that you have done.</description>

      <description>Long ago (the first half of my grad school life), I created a model for a manuscript I submitted. The paper was focused on adolescentsâ€™ appraisals of their relationships with their mothers, fathers, and best friends. Specifically, I wanted to test whether the association between different motivations for social withdrawal (i.e., removing oneself from social activities and interactions) and internalizing symptoms varied as a function of perceived support in any one (or all three) of these relationships.</description>
