      <description>You worked hard to collect, clean, and process your data. It is finally ready for that step where you get you need to finalize your documentation. After all, it is rarely just you, the person hunched over his/her computer for the past 2 weeks learning every nook and cranny of the data, who is going to need understand and explore its contents. You can have people ask you a million and one questions.</description>

      <description>Overview: This is the first post in a three-part blog series I am putting together. The focus of this initial post is effective exploration of the reasons for missingness in a particular set of data. The second post in the series will focus on running and evaluating the imputation model itself after having identified the appropriate covariates that help account for missingness. The third and final post will be a walkthrough of the final models and their interpretation - including a comparison of the same models using listwise deletion (which is bad unless missingness is small or definitely, 100% completely at random).</description>
