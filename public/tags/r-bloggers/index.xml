      <description>Recently, I was asked to knock together a quick power analysis for a linear growth model with approximately 120 subjects. Having already collected data (i.e., having a fixed sample size), the goal of the power analysis was to explore whether a sample of 120 subjects would be sufficient to detect significant linear change (\(\alpha = .05\)) for a secondary research question that was not part of the original proposal (we added collection of a set of variables partway through the data collection period).</description>

      <description>(Updated: 2020-12-24)
When would it not be good to have a way to forecast the future? Honestly, I lack the imagination to provide an answer, though Iâ€™ll admit there are likely edge cases I am not considering. But on average, all things being equal, it is better to know than to not know what is coming. For companies, the ability to accurately forecast events is the business model.
The simplest forecast model is one in which we use trends over time to predict future events, the assumption being that the previous trend will continue essentially as is through the forecast window.</description>
