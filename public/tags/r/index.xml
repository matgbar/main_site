      <description>Recently, I was asked to knock together a quick power analysis for a linear growth model with approximately 120 subjects. The power analysis was for a grant application. Having already collected data on the sample, the goal was to explore whether a sample of 120 subjects would be sufficient to detect significant linear change (\(\alpha = .05\)) for a secondary research question that which was not part of the original proposal (we added collection of a set of variables part way through the data collection period).</description>

      <description>A well-established set of problems emerges when attempting to analyze non-stationary univariate time series (i.e., the signalâ€™s mean and/or variance changes over time). A common approach is to impose some stationarity on the data so that certain modeling techniques can provide allow a research to make some predictions (e.g., ARIMA models). The selection of the appropriate assumptions to make when forcing a time series into stationarity is difficult to automate in many circumstances, requiring that a researcher evaluate competing models.</description>
