When would it not be good to have a way to forecast the future? Honestly, I lack the imagination to provide an answer, though Iâ€™ll admit there are likely edge cases I am not considering. But on average, all things being equal, it is better to know than to not know what is coming. For companies, the ability to accurately forecast events is the business model.
The simplest forecast model is one in which we use trends over time to predict future events, the assumption being that the previous trend will continue essentially as is through the forecast window.</description>
