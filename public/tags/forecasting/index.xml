      <description>A Rose by Any Other Name: Statistics, Machine Learning, and AI I was recently interviewing for a job and a recruiter asked me if I wanted to enhance aspects of my machine learning background on my resume before she passed it on for the next round of reviews. I resisted the urge to chide her in the moment by pointing out the flawed distinction between statistics and machine learning, an unnecessary admonishment that would have been to no one’s benefit.</description>

      <description>A well-established set of problems emerges when attempting to analyze non-stationary univariate time series (i.e., the signal’s mean and/or variance changes over time). A common approach is to impose some stationarity on the data so that certain modeling techniques can provide allow a research to make some predictions (e.g., ARIMA models). The selection of the appropriate assumptions to make when forcing a time series into stationarity is difficult to automate in many circumstances, requiring that a researcher evaluate competing models.</description>
