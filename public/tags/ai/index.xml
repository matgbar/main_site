      <description>In the first post in this series, I described the impetus for this trek through statistical modeling, machine learning and artificial intelligence. I also provided an initial set of comparisons for three different approaches to classification: k-means, k-nearest neighbor, and latent profile analysis (model-based clustering). If you want to check those mini-walkthroughs out click here.
As a reminder, my goal here is to compare and contrast different approaches to data analysis and predictive modeling that are, in my mind, arbitrarily lumped into statistical modeling and machine learing/artificial intelligence categories.</description>

      <description>I was recently interviewing for a job and a recruiter asked me if I wanted to enhance aspects of my machine learning background on my resume before she passed it on for the next round of reviews. I resisted the urge to chide her in the moment by pointing out the flawed distinction between statistics and machine learning, an unnecessary admonishment that would have been to no oneâ€™s benefit. The modal outcome would have been me sounding as if I was speaking with all of the arrogance, jackassery, and superiority that a recently minted Ph.</description>
