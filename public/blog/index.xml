      <description>Spurred on by Alex Shackman, I have been working to figure out a good way to visualize different sources of variation in momentary mood. The most common way of visually depicting variance decompositions from the sort of multilevel models we used to analyze our data is a stacked bar plot. So that seemed like a good place to start.

 Now, choosing a color scheme that screams “HI I’M A COLOR!</description>

      <description>Long ago (the first half of my grad school life), I created a model for a manuscript I submitted. The paper was focused on adolescents’ appraisals of their relationships with their mothers, fathers, and best friends. Specifically, I wanted to test whether the association between different motivations for social withdrawal (i.e., removing oneself from social activities and interactions) and internalizing symptoms varied as a function of perceived support in any one (or all three) of these relationships.</description>

      <description>Recently, I was asked to knock together a quick power analysis for a linear growth model with approximately 120 subjects. Having already collected data (i.e., having a fixed sample size), the goal of the power analysis was to explore whether a sample of 120 subjects would be sufficient to detect significant linear change (\(\alpha = .05\)) for a secondary research question that was not part of the original proposal (we added collection of a set of variables partway through the data collection period).</description>

      <description>A well-established set of problems emerges when attempting to analyze non-stationary univariate time series (i.e., the signal’s mean and/or variance changes over time). A common approach is to impose some stationarity on the data so that certain modeling techniques can provide allow a research to make some predictions (e.g., ARIMA models). The selection of the appropriate assumptions to make when forcing a time series into stationarity is difficult to automate in many circumstances, requiring that a researcher evaluate competing models.</description>
