# Biography

Matthew Barstead is a doctoral candidate in the Department of Human Development and Quantiative Methodology at the University of Maryland. Generally speaking, his research focuses on individual and contextual factors that predict social and emotional maladaptation across childhood and adolescence. Recently, he has worked on developing a new, open-source program for processing and editing heart data. These data are used in his work as a physiological predictor of variation in adjustment/maladjustment.
