# Biography

Matthew Barstead is a doctoral candidate in the Department of Human Development and Quantiative Methodology at the University of Maryland. To date, much of his work has focused on identifying individual and contextual factors that serve to maintain and exacerbate maladaptive social and emotional development, with a primary focus on anxiety, depression, and social withdrawal. Recently, his research has grown to include the measurement of autonomic dysregulation as a biomarker of deficient self-regulatory capacities. A primary interest of his is the development of open-source tools to aid researchers in their efforts to effectively extract features from peripheral physiological measures that can be used to improve mental health diagnoses and/or monitor treatment response. His approach to the creation of these tools is best characterized as a marriage of machine learning/statistical modeling with trained user oversight, in the hopes that their combination achieves an effective balance between efficiency and accuracy.
