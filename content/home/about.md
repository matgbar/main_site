# Biography

I recently received my Ph.D. from the Department of Human Development and Quantitative Methodology at the University of Maryland. To date, much of my work has focused on identifying individual and contextual factors that serve to maintain and exacerbate maladaptive social and emotional development, with a primary focus on anxiety, depression, and social withdrawal. Recently, my research has grown to include the measurement of autonomic dysregulation as a biomarker of deficient self-regulatory capacities. A primary interest of mine is the creation of open-source tools to aid researchers in their efforts to effectively extract features from peripheral physiological measures. These features can then be used to improve mental health diagnoses, monitor treatment response, and conduct basic research. My approach to the creation of these tools is best characterized as a marriage of machine learning/statistical modeling with trained user oversight, in the hopes that their combination achieves an effective balance between efficiency and accuracy.
