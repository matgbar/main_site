**Abstract:** Callous-unemotional (CU) traits are central to our understanding of antisocial behavior, which is harmful, financially costly to society, and hard to treat. Theoretical and diagnostic models define CU traits based on a lack of empathy, guilt, and prosociality. However, there has been no comprehensive quantitative synthesis of results to support this claim, nor any examination of whether associations differ by age, gender, sample type, or informant. Given its centrality to our understanding and treatment of antisocial behavior, the time is ripe for a critical examination of the meaning of the CU traits construct, including associations with its purported underlying features of low empathy, guilt, and prosociality, and potential demographic and methodological moderators of these associations. To address this gap in the literature, we conducted a systematic search of the literature on CU traits and identified 82 effect sizes from 51 studies (*N* = 30,475) that quantified the magnitude of the association between CU traits and either empathy, prosociality, or guilt. The results revealed statistically significant, modest-to-moderate negative correlations between CU traits and empathy (*k* = 25, $\rho$  = -.21), CU traits and guilt (*k* = 3, $\rho$ = -.18), and CU traits and prosociality (*k* = 16, $\rho$ = -.28). The magnitude of the negative association between CU traits and prosociality was stronger among younger children. In addition, the negative correlations between CU traits and both prosociality and cognitive empathy were stronger when the informant was a parent or teacher. We discuss how these findings can inform theory, conceptualization, and measurement of CU traits across the lifespan, as well as implications for models of antisocial behavior and moral development.
