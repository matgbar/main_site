[Dr. Ken Rubin](https://education.umd.edu/directory/kenneth-rubin) has spent the majority of his career studying the causes, correlates, and consequences of childhood anxiety and social withdrawal. As a result of an ongoing collaboration with [Dr. Andrea Chronis-Tuscano](https://psyc.umd.edu/facultyprofile/Chronis-Tuscano/Andrea), a clinical psychology professor and researcher, and in consultation with [Dr. Rob Coplan](https://carleton.ca/psychology/people/robert-coplan/), this career has recently been translated into the creation of an early intervention program. The intervention, named the *Turtle Program*, simultaneously targets maladaptive parenting behaviors known to maintain and exacerbate childhood anxiety in addition to anxious and inhibited children's social skills and emotion regulation deficits. 

Pilot work comparing the treatment against a waitlist control group demonstrated promising results insofar as [reducing anxiety symptoms](http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0039043) and [improving adaptive social behaviors](https://mgb-research.netlify.com/publication/barstead_etal_2018_jcfs/). As of June 2018, we have completed initial data collection for the follow-up investigation comparing the *Turtle Program* against an established parent psychoeducation intervention for shy and inhibited children (known as [Cool Little Kids](https://coollittlekids.org.au/login)). While we continued to gather information about children and parents a year after participating in one of the two interventions, we have just started to compile our initial findings.
