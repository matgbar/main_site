abstract = "In many ways this chapter concerns a  topic unlike most that appear in this Handbook. Rather than focusing on  the ways in which children and adolescents may interact with their  peers, this chapter is centered on those youth who, for whatever reason, engage in comparatively little peer interaction. As noted throughout  this Handbook, children who are socially engaging and competent interact with peers in ways that allow the establishment and maintenance of  positive relationships. Such children fare well in their social and  academic lives. However, their socially unskilled counterparts often  suffer from peer rejection, friendlessness, and loneliness; furthermore, they are thought to be at risk for a wide range of socioemotional and  academic difficulties (see Rubin, Bukowski, & Bowker, 2015 for a  review). In this chapter, we focus on children who avoid and rarely  interact with their peers and who may suffer deeply for their  withdrawal."
