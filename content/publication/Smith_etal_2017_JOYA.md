abstract = "Social withdrawal places adolescents at risk of developing internalizing problems. Personality traits also relate to internalizing difficulties. For example, high conscientiousness and low neuroticism predict fewer anxiety and depression symptoms. Adolescents reported on their personality traits in 8th grade and their internalizing problems in 9th grade, and peers nominated socially withdrawn classmates. A structural equation model revealed that 8th grade withdrawal positively predicted 9th grade anxiety and depression, but neuroticism did not. Conscientiousness moderated the relation of withdrawal with depression but not anxiety, such that high conscientiousness attenuated the association between withdrawal and depression. This buffering effect may stem from the conceptual relation between conscientiousness and self-regulation. Thus, a conscientious, well-regulated personality partially protects withdrawn adolescents from increased internalizing difficulties."
