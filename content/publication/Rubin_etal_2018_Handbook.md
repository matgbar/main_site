abstract = "In many ways this chapter concerns a topic unlike most that appear in this Handbook. Rather than focusing on the ways in which children and adolescents may interact with their peers, this chapter is centered on those youth who, for whatever reason, engage in comparatively little peer interaction. As noted throughout this Handbook, children who are socially engaging and competent interact with peers in ways that allow the establishment and maintenance of positive relationships. Such children fare well in their social and academic lives. However, their socially unskilled counterparts often suffer from peer rejection, friendlessness, and loneliness; furthermore, they are thought to be at risk for a wide range of socioemotional and academic difficulties (see Rubin, Bukowski, & Bowker, 2015 for a review). In this chapter, we focus on children who avoid and rarely interact with their peers and who may suffer deeply for their withdrawal."
