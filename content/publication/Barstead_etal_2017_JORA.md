abstract = "We examined differential outcomes related to two distinct motivations for withdrawal (preference for solitude and shyness) as well as the possibility that support from important others (mothers, fathers, and best friends) attenuate any such links. Adolescents (159 males, 171 females) reported on their motivations to withdraw, internalizing symptoms, and relationship quality in 8 th grade, as well as their anxiety and depression in 9 th grade. Using structural equation modeling, we found that maternal support weakened the association between shyness and internalizing problems; friend support weakened the association between preference for solitude and depression; and friend support strengthened the association between shyness and depression. Our results suggest shy adolescents may not derive the same benefits from supportive friendships as their typical peers."
