abstract = {The brms package implements Bayesian multilevel models in R using the probabilistic programming language Stan. A wide range of distributions and link functions are supported, allowing users to fit  -  among others  -  linear, robust linear, binomial, Poisson, survival, ordinal, zero-inflated, hurdle, and even non-linear models all in a multilevel context. Further modeling options include autocorrelation of the response variable, user defined covariance structures, censored data, as well as meta-analytic standard errors. Prior specifications are flexible and explicitly encourage users to apply prior distributions that actually reflect their beliefs. In addition, model fit can easily be assessed and compared with the Watanabe-Akaike information criterion and leave-one-out cross-validation.},

abstract = {Dispositional negativity-the propensity to experience and express more frequent, intense, or enduring negative affect-is a fundamental dimension of childhood temperament and adult personality. Elevated levels of dispositional negativity can have profound consequences for health, wealth, and happiness, drawing the attention of clinicians, researchers, and policymakers. Here, we highlight recent advances in our understanding of the psychological and neurobiological processes linking stable individual differences in dispositional negativity to momentary emotional states. Self-report data suggest that 3 key pathways-increased stressor reactivity, tonic increases in negative affect, and increased stressor exposure-explain most of the heightened negative affect that characterizes individuals with a more negative disposition. Of these 3 pathways, tonically elevated, indiscriminate negative affect appears to be most central to daily life and most relevant to the development of psychopathology. New behavioral and biological data provide insights into the neural systems underlying these 3 pathways and motivate the hypothesis that seemingly "tonic" increases in negative affect may actually reflect increased reactivity to stressors that are remote, uncertain, or diffuse. Research focused on humans, monkeys, and rodents suggests that this indiscriminate negative affect reflects trait-like variation in the activity and connectivity of several key brain regions, including the central extended amygdala and parts of the prefrontal cortex. Collectively, these observations provide an integrative psychobiological framework for understanding the dynamic cascade of processes that bind emotional traits to emotional states and, ultimately, to emotional disorders and other kinds of adverse outcomes.

abstract = {Investigated mechanisms through which neuroticism leads to distress in daily life in 339 adults who provided daily reports of minor stressful events for 6 wks. Neuroticism may lead to distress through exposing people to a greater number of stressful events, through increasing their reactivity to those events, or through a mechanism unrelated to environmental events. The relative importance of these 3 explanations is evaluated. Findings show exposure and reactivity to minor stressors explained over 40{\%} of the distress difference between high- and low-neuroticism Ss. Reactivity to stressors accounted for twice as much of the distress difference as exposure to stressors. Results suggest that reactions within stressful situations are more important than situation selection in explaining how neuroticism leads to distress in daily life. (PsycINFO 2000)},

abstract = {When extreme, anxiety can become debilitating and contribute to the etiology of depression and substanceabuse. Anxiety disorders are common and challenging to treat, yet the neurocognitive mechanisms that conferincreased risk have only recently begun to come into focus. Here we review recent work highlighting theimportance of neural circuits centered on the amygdala. Converging lines of epidemiological, physiological, andmechanistic evidence indicate that the amygdala supports stable individual differences in dispositionalnegativity and contributes to the etiology of anxiety disorders and related stress-sensitive psychopathologies.Hyper-vigilance and attentional biases to threat are prominent features of the anxious phenotype and there isgrowing evidence that they contribute to the development of psychopathology. Anatomical studies show thatthe amygdala is a hub, poised to govern attention to threat via projections to sensory cortex and ascendingneuromodulatory systems. Imaging and lesion studies demonstrate that the amygdala plays a key role inenhancing the processing of potentially threat-relevant cues. Collectively, these observations provide aneurobiologically-grounded framework for understanding the development and maintenance of anxietydisorders and set the stage for developing improved intervention strategies.},

abstract = {The aims were to evaluate sleepiness and recovery during a schedule change, and during an 84-hours workweek. The control group (16 men) stayed on a six-week schedule, whereas the intervention group (12 men) transferred to a seven-week schedule. Sleepiness was estimated, using the KSS-scale, four times during the first and the third night in the fifth or sixth shift week. Recovery was assessed through four estimations on days one, three and five during the week off. Statistical testing was carried out using repeated measurement ANOVA. Sleepiness at night was affected by night (F = 4.90, p {\textless} 0.05) and hour (F = 33.64, p {\textless} 0.001) in both groups. The intervention group was sleepier during the first recovery day compared to the control group (F = 4.02, p {\textless} 0.05). Analysis of the 84-hour-week showed an effect of night (F = 8.98, p {\textless} 0.05) and hour (F = 71.60, p {\textless} 0.001) on night work, and day (F = 22.49, p {\textless} 0.01) and hour (F = 6.66, p {\textless} 0.05) on recovery. Sleepiness was more pronounced on the first recovery day (F = 23.08, p {\textless} 0.01). The seven-week schedule showed no effect that differed from that of the control group on sleepiness during the night shift. After the 84-hour workweek the workers recovered in about three days. The new schedules may affect the first recovery day negatively.},

abstract = {Statisticians most often use the linear mixed model to analyze Gaussian longitudinal data. The value and familiarity of the R2 statistic in the linear univariate model naturally creates great interest in extending it to the linear mixed model. We define and describe how to compute a model R2 statistic for the linear mixed model by using only a single model. The proposed R2 statistic measures multivariate association between the repeated outcomes and the fixed effects in the linear mixed model. The R2 statistic arises as a 1–1 function of an appropriate F statistic for testing all fixed effects (except typically the intercept) in a full model. The statistic compares the full model with a null model with all fixed effects deleted (except typically the intercept) while retaining exactly the same covariance structure. Furthermore, the R2 statistic leads immediately to a natural definition of a partial R2 statistic. A mixed model in which ethnicity gives averysmall p-value as a longitudinal predictor of blood pressure (BP) compellingly illustrates the value of the statistic. In sharp contrast to the extreme p-value, a very small R2, a measure of statistical and scientific importance, indicates that ethnicity has an almost negligible association with the repeated BP outcomes for the study.},

abstract = {Researchers often mention the utility and need for R-squared measures of explained variance for multilevel models (MLMs). Although this topic has been addressed by methodologists, the MLM R-squared literature suffers from several shortcomings: (a) analytic relationships among existing measures have not been established so measures equivalent in the population have been redeveloped 2 or 3 times; (b) a completely full partitioning of variance has not been used to create measures, leading to gaps in the availability of measures to address key substantive questions; (c) a unifying approach to interpreting and choosing among measures has not been provided, leading to researchers' difficulty with implementation; and (d) software has inconsistently and infrequently incorporated available measures. We address these issues with the following contributions. We develop an integrative framework of R-squared measures for MLMs with random intercepts and/or slopes based on a completely full decomposition of variance. We analytically relate 10 existing measures from different disciplines as special cases of 5 measures from our framework. We show how our framework fills gaps by supplying additional total and level-specific measures that answer new substantive research questions. To facilitate interpretation, we provide a novel and integrative graphical representation of all the measures in the framework; we use it to demonstrate limitations of current reporting practices for MLM R-squareds, as well as benefits of considering multiple measures from the framework in juxtaposition. We supply and empirically illustrate an R function, r2MLM, that computes all measures in our framework to help researchers in considering effect size and conveying practical significance.
