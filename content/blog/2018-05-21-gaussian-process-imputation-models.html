<p>When would it not be good to have a way to forecast the future? Honestly, I lack the imagination to provide an answer, though I’ll admit there are likely edge cases I am not considering. But on average, all things being equal, it is better to know than to not know what is coming. For companies, the ability to accurately forecast events <em>is</em> the business model.</p>
<p>The simplest forecast model is one in which we use trends over time to predict future events, the assumption being that the previous trend will continue essentially as is through the forecast window. That seem like a simple forecast model, but the trick is what a given model represents as the “trend.” For some data, a linear model is going to make perfect sense:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2018-05-21-gaussian-process-imputation-models_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>For others, such a simple model is not going to be very effective.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2018-05-21-gaussian-process-imputation-models_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The linear model here alone is a not a particularly good fit, though there is clearly an average change over time. However, equally clear is that there is a seasonal pattern that is increasing in its magnitude over time. The linear model as defined in the plot above does not know how to handle such a pattern.</p>
<p>Let’s say the prediction challenge here is to forecast airline passengers in 1960 using only airline passenger data from the preceding years. We know a simple linear change over time approach is not going to work or at least is probably not our best model - though it is better than no model since it would at least capture the upward trend. Since our only data here is a uni-dimensional time-series the question is how can we effectively model associations between monthly airline passengers across time.</p>
<p>First, before we get started, let’s split the data up into the training and test sets.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>air_pass_train &lt;- air_pass_tbl %&gt;% 
  filter(year &lt; 1960)

air_pass_test &lt;- air_pass_tbl %&gt;% 
  filter(year &gt;= 1960)</code></pre>
<p>I at least three, maybe even four properties of the raw data that I would like to capture in my model:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Over time there is an average increase in the number of passengers.</li>
<li>There is a seasonal trend on top of the average increase that appears to be annual in nature, which would make sense for the airline industry in then (and probably now - COVID crisis notwithstanding).</li>
<li>The effect of the seasonal trends is more pronounced over time</li>
<li>There <em>may</em>, and I stress <em>may</em> be a slight acceleration in the, long-term increase in monthly passengers</li>
</ol>
<p>So can I create a model that includes somehow accounts for all of these different features of the timeseries? Let’s find out. I tend to like to start building simple models and move up from there. We’ll start by simply creating a model based on the idea that time points closer together will have airline passenger values that are more similar than those that are farther apart? How close? How much of an effect? I’ll use the squared exponential covariance kernel to help me derive these answers from the data.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[k(t,t&#39;) = \sigma^2 exp\Big(-\frac{(t-t&#39;)^2}{2l_1^2}\Big)\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span> is the estimated variance accounted for by the function <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> is a length scale parameter that governs the decay rate. Smaller estimated values for <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> indicate a faster decay rate in the covariance between two points as a function of time.</p>
<p>Let’s get the data ready:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>m1_data &lt;- list(
  N1 = nrow(air_pass_train), 
  N2 = nrow(air_pass_test), 
  X = air_pass_train[[&#39;year&#39;]], 
  Y = air_pass_train[[&#39;pass&#39;]], 
  Xp = air_pass_test[[&#39;year&#39;]]
)</code></pre>
<p>The model variables are:
- <code>N1</code>: the number of observations in the prediction set
- <code>N2</code>: the number of observation in the test set
- <code>X</code>: evenly spaced interval - in this case time as measured in months
- <code>Y</code>: passengers in a given month
- <code>Xp</code>: the prediction window (which set of months/which time window to generate predicted passenger rates)</p>
<p>Now for the <code>Stan</code> code:</p>

<p>The model will converge, and at least on my machine with that seed there is some evidence that it had a hard time getting started. The posterior distributions seem pretty good - for the most part there is evidence of good mixing of the chains. Note that I tend to use a higher number of chains for initial analyses to help diagnose convergence issues.</p>

<p>Before adding another function, we should consider the fact that the distribution we care most about modeling (number of monthly passengers) is not likely normally distributed. Currently the model makes the assumption that it is, which may have contributed to some of the initial warning messages the <code>Stan</code> model returned. There are a few options, but I think a simple log-transform should work here. A little tweak of the code adding to the transformed data block:</p>
<pre class="stan"><code>transformed data { 
    vector[N1] mu;
    vector[N1] y_log;
    for(n in 1:N1){
      mu[n] = 0;
      y_log[n] = log(Y[n]);
    }

<p>Despite the greater degree of uncertainty, visual inspection of the plots leads me to think that the log-transformed approach is a little better. The lack of warning messages is also a plus. Neither of these models is particularly good. Which is why we are going to add another GP that accounts for seasonality in the time series.</p>

<p>Well that is a huge improvement over the first few models. Adding in a term that addresses the obvious seasonal pattern improved model predictions immensely. My only gripe at this point is the fact that the “mean” posterior estimate tends to undershoot the observed data on average. It could just be the restricted range and the model would over predict the next few months.</p>

The fit is better though - noticeably so. And, the uncertainty intervals behave in a more satisfying manner: the farther in the future from the most recent data point used to train the parameters, the more uncertainty the model should have about its predictions.&#39;)) +

Gaussian process models offer a flexible framework for detecting and stacking latent change processes and can be turned into forecast models on out-of-sample observations. The secret is that the sum of any set of Gaussian processes is itself a Gaussian process:</p>
<p>-AND MOST SENSIBLE FORMULA HERE.</p>
<p>A well-established set of problems emerges when attempting to analyze non-stationary univariate time series (i.e., the signal’s mean and/or variance changes over time). A common approach is to impose some stationarity on the data (e.g., ARIMA models). The selection of the appropriate assumptions to make when forcing a time series into stationarity is difficult to automate in many circumstances, requiring that a researcher evaluate competing models.</p>
<p>The models below will make use of the preloaded <code>AirPassengers</code> data in R. The data represent the total number of monthly international airline passengers (in thousands) from 1949 to 1960. It is easy to see these data have both a non-stationary mean and a non-stationary variance. There is also a clear periodic component to these data.</p>
