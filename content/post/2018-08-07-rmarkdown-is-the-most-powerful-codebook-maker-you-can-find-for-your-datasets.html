<p>You worked hard to collect, clean, and process your data. Now your dataset is finally ready for that final step. That put a bow on it and send it to all your colleagues phase. You are at that moment when you release a deep sigh of relief at the end of the hard (sometimes underappreciated) work of data wrangling. Now you have to make something that communicates all that you have done. A dataset is often only as good as its documentation. After all, it is rarely <em>only</em> you, the person hunched over his/her computer for the past 2 weeks learning every nook and cranny of the data, who is going to need understand and explore the data’s contents. You can have different people ask you a million and one questions about where everything is and how it was all coded.</p>
<p>Or…</p>
<p>You could create a manual that is complete, easy to you use, readily tweakable, completely reproducible, and 100% shareable. Having made a couple of manuals in my time as a former camp director and current Ph.D. candidate, I appreciate well-put-together informational resources that I can consult to quickly find the answer I want.</p>
<p>By integrating R’s powerful coding, graphing, and analytic abilities directly with LaTex, Rmarkdown lets you create a completely comprehensive record of everything you have done to your data (any errors can be easily tracked back to the code) while also producing a practically useful and aesthetically pleasing (at least to my eye) manual that can be shared with your research group. To see an example of its power check out an early draft of the manual I created for our current project (these data are raw, may contain as yet undiscovered inaccuracies and are not for public use).
